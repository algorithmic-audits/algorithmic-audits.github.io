# 1rst Workshop on Algorithmic Audits of Algorithms (WAAA)
## May 23rd 2023 - Online (Zoom): 8am EST (2pm CET) 

<img src="./waa-small.jpeg" width="600" alt="banner" class="center">

Nowadays, many crucial algorithms (recommendation, scoring, ranking and classification) are operated at third party providers, without users or institutions having any insights on how they operate on their data. Such a black-box setup challenges scientists to show what is [feasible in terms of audits](https://github.com/erwanlemerrer/awesome-audit-algorithms), both on theoretical and efficiency-oriented aspects.\
This workshop aims at summing up the current state of algorithmic-audits through recent scientific advances.

*The workshop will take place online (Zoom), please register to attend (see below).*
