Nowadays, many crucial algorithms (recommendation, scoring, ranking and classification) are operated at third party providers, without users or institutions having any insights on how they operate on their data. Such a black-box setup challenges scientists to show what is [feasible in terms of audits](https://github.com/erwanlemerrer/awesome-audit-algorithms), both on theoretical and efficiency-oriented aspects.\
This workshop aims at summing up the current state of algorithmic-audits through recent scientific advances.
