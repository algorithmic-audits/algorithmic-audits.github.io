Nowadays, many crucial algorithms (recommendation, scoring, ranking and classification) are operated at third party providers, without users or institutions having any insights on how they operate on their data. Such a black-box setup challenges scientists to show what is [feasible in terms of audits](https://github.com/erwanlemerrer/awesome-audit-algorithms), both on theoretical and efficiency-oriented aspects.\
This workshop aims at summing up the current state of algorithmic-audits through recent scientific advances.

First confirmed papers to be presented:
 - A zest of lime: towards architecture-independent model distances, ICLR 2022.
 - Confidential-PROFITT: Confidential PROof of FaIr Training of Trees, under review.
 - Remote Explainability faces the bouncer problem, Nature Mach Int 2020.
 - Tubes & Bubbles - Topological confinement of YouTube recommendations, PLOS ONE 2020. 
 - TBA
